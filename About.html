      give
      you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of
      the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure
      itself, because
      it is pleasure, but because
      those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again
      is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally
      circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us
      ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find
      fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences,
      or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure "</p>
