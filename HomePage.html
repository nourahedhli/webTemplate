  <h3 >Noura Hedhli</h3>
  <div class="content">

  <p align="justify">"I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will
    give
    you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of
    the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure
    itself, because
    it is pleasure, but because
    those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again
    is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally
    circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us
    ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find
    fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences,
    or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure "</p>
